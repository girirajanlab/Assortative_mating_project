# Description
Pipelines and scripts used to perform the bioinformatics analyses examining the parental factors driving pathogenicity of variably expressive variants.

Preprocessing of files are very similar for all cohorts, but scripts for each cohort are provided in 0_preprocessing.
Analyses of each cohort are primarily organized by the cohort of interest and files related to analyses for each cohort can be found in their respective directories.
